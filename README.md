# Pedestrian-Detection-Using-Mask-RCNN
Mask R-CNN based Pedestrian Detection
Abstract
This study offers a generic, adaptable, and conceptually straightforward framework for object instance segmentation. Fundamental computer vision problems, such as recognizing pedestrians, have a wide range of applications in the industries of security, surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. Our method effectively locates things in a picture while also producing a top-notch segmentation mask for each object. By adding a branch for predicting an object mask in tandem with the existing branch for bounding box recognition, the technique known as Mask R-CNN expands Faster R-CNN. Faster R-CNN is run at 5 frames per second while Mask R-CNN adds only a little overhead. Occlusions still operate as a substantial obstacle even if persons detection is currently regarded to be a widely used technique. Here, we are striving to improve the detection performance in every way in order to more effectively manage the occlusion problem.<img width="468" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4146278-274b-49ef-8d2c-a44fb89d6303" />
